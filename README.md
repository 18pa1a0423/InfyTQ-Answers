```Hey there everyone!```

Glad to have you here. Looking for resources for InfyTQ? Well, you are at the right place.

I am Omkar Deshpande and this is my github repo consisting of all the solutions to InfyTQ. I prepared this while I was preparing for InfyTQ exam back in June 2019. I always had to go back and check my solutions for revision, so instead thought to make a github repo, which is mobile handy and can also be used by others looking for a reference.

I would soon be uploading a blog on how I was able to ***crack the Power Programmer Interview*** and got selected for a Power Programmer Role at Infosys. I would mention all the resources used. Remember, the best resource available is your will-power! Donot rely on any paid courses or online services, and work on yourself every single day with consistency, and I am sure you would land at your dream job!

Further, I request you to please also update me the changes/incorrect/updations in this Solutions Repository. I would love to include your solutions/alternatives within this repo. Lets make this repo more and more generalised for the students preparing on InfyTQ platform.
